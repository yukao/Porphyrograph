This is the initial architecture for projects:
- sources are different for each project (folder SourcesBefore18):
	: VirChor for NINE and CityWalk
	: DM for d-CONT
	: porphyrograph_dedicated for alKemi, ateliers_portatifs, geneMuse, MaisonSensible, TVWinstall and other minor projects
- project files (shaders, configuration, scenario...) are grouped in the corresponding project folder
- interface is separate and is a different PD file for each project (except ateliers portatifs with QT)
