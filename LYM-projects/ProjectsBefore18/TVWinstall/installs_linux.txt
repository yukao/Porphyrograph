To install nvidia, start the system in low graphics mode and then run the following commands.

First, fully update the system:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Next, open "additional drivers" from your system settings menu.

Wait a few moments for the system to properly detect the available drivers and then choose the "tested" proprietary driver from the list.

Then, run the following commands to install bumblebee:

sudo apt-get install bumblebee* primus

Reboot
