SUPPORTED FORMATS for -F Option:

  FORMATTER TYPE htmltable: Formatter which produces HTML with tables.

    The output from this formatter is not generally suitable for
    printing, but works fine for online documentation.  The primary
    concern with printing the output is that the nested tables can
    cause pages to be very wide, especially with a lot of nesting of
    classes.  Printable HTML output should be addressed by another
    formatter.

      Parameters

        compactHTML -- A boolean switch to cause the formatter
                       to generate more compact HTML.  Extra
                       whitespace is removed in order to make the
                       generated files take up less space and
                       download more quickly.  The default is
                       False to cause output to be more readable.
      
        filenamePrefix -- A prefix to preprend to the base names of
                          files and directories being created.  This
                          is useful for situations where the names
                          which would be automatically generated might
                          cause a name clash or conflict.

        pageBackgroundColor -- Background color for HTML pages

        levelOneHeadingBackgroundColor -- Background color for level
                                          one heading sections.

        levelOneHeadingForegroundColor -- Foreground color for level
                                          one heading sections.

        levelTwoHeadingBackgroundColor -- Background color for level
                                          two heading sections

        levelTwoHeadingForegroundColor -- Foreground color for level
                                          two heading sections.

        codeForegroundColor -- Foreground color for code blocks.

        dateStampFiles -- Boolean indicating whether or not to include
                          a date/time stamp in files.

        htmlQuoteText -- Boolean indicating whether or not to assume
                         that docstrings need to be quoted because
                         they might have special HTML characters in
                         them.  Defaults to true so that text is
                         quoted.

        debug -- Enable debugging comments in output.
      
    
  FORMATTER TYPE null: None
  FORMATTER TYPE sgmldocbook: Formatter which produces simple DocBook SGML.
  FORMATTER TYPE text: Formatter which produces plain ASCII text.

    Parameters
          
       filenamePrefix -- A prefix to append to the base names of files
                         and directories being created.  This is
                         useful for situations where the names which
                         would be automatically generated might cause
                         a name clash or conflict.
